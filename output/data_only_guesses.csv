p001,"(1, 1)","p001 already scores near the top on group TMB (Digit Symbol 87, Matrix 33, VPA 24), and his highest daily cognitive scores align with higher mental engagement (e.g., 2023-01-23 engaged=4 score=42; 2023-02-13 engaged=4 score=38), whereas anxiety is typically minimal and activity/social show mixed links—so increasing mental engagement is the likeliest boost   ."
p002,"(2, -1)","Lowering anxiety by one level is the best bet: p002’s highest daily N‑back scores co-occur on low‑anxiety days (e.g., 2023‑02‑04: anxious=1, score=38; 2023‑01‑23 also logged anxious=1 alongside a high score entry)  , whereas a higher‑anxiety day (2023‑01‑22: anxious=4) showed only average performance (score=25) . This aligns with p002’s weakest TMB domain—Verbal Paired Associates Memory (8), which trails many peers’ teens–20s—so reducing anxiety should most directly aid memory/attention and thus TMB performance   ."
p003,"(1, 1)","Reason: p003’s TMB profile shows room to improve processing speed and reasoning (e.g., Choice Reaction Time 5.92, Digit Symbol 37, Matrix Reasoning 6) relative to peers (e.g., p001 Digit Symbol 87) . On p003’s own daily data, higher N-back scores co-occur with higher mental engagement (scores 36 on days with engaged=4–5; Feb 10–11) while elevated anxiety corresponds to lower scores (26 when anxious=4; Feb 7)  . Since anxiety is usually low and social contact often high for p003, increasing mental engagement by one level is the most promising single change to boost TMB outcomes  ."
p004,"(1, 1)","p004 often reports minimal mental engagement (e.g., engaged=1 on 2023-02-17 and 2023-02-13)  , while their TMB Matrix Reasoning is notably low (8) compared with many peers scoring in the 20–35 range; boosting daily mental engagement is the clearest lever to raise overall TMB performance  ."
p005,"(1, 1)","Reason: p005’s TMB profile leaves room to improve (e.g., Choice RT 7.59, Digit Symbol 58, Forward Span 4, Matrix 17, Verbal Pairs 12), and across users the highest TMB performers tend to report higher mental engagement (e.g., p001 with very strong TMB scores often logs high engagement), while for p005 her better on-watch N-back days also line up with higher engagement (and not reliably with activity or social level). So nudging mental engagement up one level is the most promising lever to boost TMB scores."
p006,"(2, -1)","Reducing anxiety is the likeliest broad win for p006’s TMB profile: their Verbal Paired Associates Memory score is relatively low (11) compared with many peers (e.g., p041: 18; p015: 25; p029: 22), while other domains are midrange (Choice RT 9.17, Digit Symbol 57, Forward Span 7, Matrix 22), and their within-person daily data show the sharpest drops in N-back performance on higher-anxiety days (e.g., Feb 14 IBS-related anxiety, score 20) versus typical low-anxiety days (often 32–34), so lowering anxiety should most improve attention/encoding speed and memory across the targeted tests       ."
p007,"(1, 1)","Increase mental engagement: Across users, higher TMB performers often report frequent mental engagement (e.g., p010 shows a strong TMB profile alongside frequent engagement; p021 is similar: TMB strong and engagement frequent), and your own better N‑back days tend to occur when you report being engaged; with anxiety already low most days, an engagement boost is the clearest lever for Choice RT, Digit‑Symbol, Digit Span, Matrix Reasoning, and Verbal Pairs gains        ."
p008,"(1, 1)","Across users, higher mental engagement tends to co‑occur with stronger cognitive performance: high TMB performers such as p001 often report frequent/always mental engagement in their daily logs (and have top-end Choice RT and Digit Symbol scores) . For p008 specifically, days with higher engagement align with better N‑back scores (e.g., engaged 3 → 27 vs. engaged 1–2 → 23–24) , while anxiety is already minimal and social contact shows inconsistent links with performance (e.g., high social but very low score) . Given p008’s room to improve on several TMB domains (e.g., Verbal Paired Associates 10, Choice RT 6.56) relative to peers , nudging mental engagement up by one level is the most targeted lever."
p009,"(1, 1)","p009’s weakest TMB area is Verbal Paired Associates Memory (7) compared to her other TMB scores (e.g., Digit Symbol 44, Matrix 24), and she reports consistently low daily mental engagement (~2), so increasing mental engagement by one level is the most likely lever to improve memory-related TMB performance; anxiety is already minimal, and in both her own logs and other users’ data, higher engagement days align with better cognitive scores (e.g., p009 engaged=2 with scores 23–27; p065 engaged=3 with scores 36–37), while higher social contact and activity show mixed effects (e.g., social=4 day scored 11)     ."
p010,"(1, 1)","Reason: In this dataset, higher cognitive performance clusters with higher self‑reported mental engagement; for example, a day with engagement at 5 coincided with a top N‑back score of 39 in another user , while p010 typically reports engagement around 2–3 (room to increase) . Given the TMB domains we aim to improve (Choice RT, Digit Symbol, Forward Digit Span, Matrix Reasoning, Verbal Paired Associates) and p010’s baseline profile in these tests, boosting mental engagement is the most promising lever compared with activity, anxiety (already minimal), or social contact ."
p011,"(0, 1)","Rationale: Compared with many peers, p011’s TMB scores suggest room to grow (e.g., Digit Symbol 33, Forward Digit Span 3, Matrix Reasoning 13, versus peers like p010 at 54/7/27), and on his own daily logs his higher N-back performances cluster on higher-activity days (active 3–4; e.g., scores 27–30) while lower-activity days lag (e.g., active 2 → score 0), making a 1-level increase in physical activity the most promising single lever to improve overall TMB performance     ."
p012,"(1, 1)","Increase mental engagement by one level — p012’s better day-level cognitive scores align with more purposeful, mentally engaging days (e.g., 33 on 2023-02-26 when she reported being “somewhat” engaged), and the TMB domains we aim to improve (Choice Reaction Time, Digit Symbol Matching, Forward Digit Span, Matrix Reasoning, Verbal Paired Associates) are best targeted by increased cognitive engagement across users, making this the highest-upside lever for her TMB profile  ."
p013,"(1, 1)","p013’s mental engagement is usually low (1–2), and their highest on‑the‑day N‑back score occurs when engagement is higher (e.g., 2/22 engaged=3, score=30 vs 2/04 engaged=1, score=19), while their TMB memory/processing scores have room to improve (Digit Symbol=42; Verbal Paired Associates=9); anxiety is already minimal, so increasing mental engagement is the clearest lever for TMB gains   ."
p014,"(2, -1)","Reason: Among all users, those with stronger TMB profiles tend to report lower anxiety in their daily logs; for example, a high performer like p026 (Digit Symbol 72; Forward Digit Span 9) consistently had anxious=1 on days they also posted strong cognitive task scores (e.g., N-back 38–39)  . For you (p014), there’s room to lift working memory and reaction time (Forward Digit Span 5; Choice Reaction Time 7.3), and your better days often coincide with calmer reports (e.g., 2023-03-02 anxious=1, score=33 vs. 2023-02-28 anxious=3, score=17), suggesting that reducing anxiety is the change most likely to boost TMB outcomes for you   ."
p015,"(1, 1)","Increase mental engagement: p015’s best same-day cognitive scores occur on days they report being more mentally engaged (e.g., engaged=5 with N‑back 42 on 2023‑03‑09 , vs engaged=1 with N‑back 30 on 2023‑03‑05 ), and the TMB domains we’re targeting (Choice RT, Digit Symbol Matching, Forward Digit Span, Matrix Reasoning, Verbal Paired Associates) are cognitive tasks most likely to benefit from increased engagement ; by contrast, higher physical-activity days did not coincide with their top scores (active=5 yielded 35–36 on 2023‑03‑08 and 2023‑03‑10)  ."
p016,"(1, 1)","Increasing mental engagement is the best bet: p016’s highest daily N‑back scores occur on more-engaged days (e.g., engaged=5 → score=33 on 2023‑03‑02; engaged=3–4 → 30–34 on 2023‑03‑05 and 2023‑03‑08), while higher anxiety aligned with a dip (anxious=3 → 22 on 2023‑02‑08); given their TMB profile (Digit Symbol=58, Verbal Pairs=23), boosting engagement should most directly support attention/processing-speed and memory tasks     ."
p017,"(1, 1)","p017’s TMB profile has room to improve memory/processing speed (e.g., Verbal Paired Associates 15; Digit Symbol 53) , and their highest daily N-back scores occur on higher-engagement days (31 with engaged=3 on 2023-03-01; 27 with engaged=3 on 2023-03-07) and the worst when engagement is minimal (score 4 with engaged=1 on 2023-02-27)   ; since anxiety is already low most days (often 1–2) , increasing mental engagement by one level is the most promising lever."
p018,"(1, 1)","p018 usually reports low mental engagement (engaged_num ≈2 on multiple days)  , and on a day she reported being “somewhat” engaged, her daily N-back score peaked higher (29) . Her TMB profile shows room to improve in processing speed and memory (e.g., Digit Symbol 43; Verbal Paired Associates 19) relative to peers in the dataset , so increasing mental engagement by one level is the most promising lever."
p019,"(1, 1)","Your highest daily N-back scores aligned with higher self-reported mental engagement (27 on 2023-02-16 and 31 on 2023-03-01 when engaged_num=3 ), whereas higher activity without matching engagement coincided with a very low score (3 on 2023-02-14, active_num=3, engaged_num=2 ); anxiety is already minimal most days (e.g., anxious_num=1 on these dates  ), and your overall TMB levels suggest room to gain (e.g., Choice Reaction Time 3.06 vs 14.23 in a high-performing peer  ), so increasing mental engagement is the most promising lever."
p020,"(1, 1)","Across users, higher self-reported mental engagement aligns with stronger TMB scores (e.g., p043 frequently engaged with TMB Verbal Paired Associates 17 and Digit Symbol 49, and p016 somewhat engaged with VPA 23 and Digit Symbol 58), while you (p020) typically report minimal engagement and show comparatively low memory performance (VPA 8), so nudging mental engagement up is the strongest lever to improve your TMB outcomes     ."
p021,"(1, 1)","p021 often reports very low mental engagement (e.g., “never” or “rarely” on 2023-02-20 and 2023-03-08)  , while their TMB profile leaves headroom to improve processing speed and memory (Choice RT 4.55; Digit Symbol 47; Verbal Pairs 17) ; across users, higher-performing TMB profiles commonly coincide with more mentally engaging days (for example, p026 shows high Digit Symbol Matching of 72 and frequently reports engaged work days)  , so a +1 in engagement is the single change most likely to help."
p022,"(1, 1)","Increase mental engagement by one level. For p022, higher self-reported mental engagement days tend to align with better same-day N-back performance (e.g., 2/22 engaged=4, score=28; 3/6 engaged=4, score=29) versus lower engagement days (2/16 engaged=2, score=17), suggesting cognitive stimulation helps; their TMB profile (e.g., Digit Symbol Matching=52, Forward Digit Span=7, Matrix Reasoning=30) leaves room for gains in speed/working memory that mental engagement could support, while anxiety is already minimal and thus not a useful lever, and social/physical activity show mixed associations in this user’s data    ."
p023,"(2, -1)","Reason: For p023, the worst daily cognitive score occurred on a higher-anxiety day (anxious_num=3, score=7 on 2023-03-09), whereas lower-anxiety days had higher scores (e.g., anxious=1, score=21 on 2023-03-15)  . Across users, lower anxiety also aligns with better daily cognition (e.g., p094 scored 33 with anxiety=2 vs 28 with anxiety=3 the next day) . Given p023’s relatively low TMB baselines in memory/processing (e.g., Digit Symbol 34; Verbal Paired Associates 6), decreasing anxiety is the most targeted change likely to improve these TMB scores ."
p024,"(0, 1)","Your TMB profile shows relatively weak speeded/associative performance (Digit Symbol Matching 21; Verbal Paired Associates 11) alongside strong span scores (Forward/Backward Digit Span both 11) . In your own daily data, higher activity days coincided with better working‑memory N‑back scores (e.g., 3/21 active=2 and 3/22 active=3 both scored 33) versus more sedentary days that tended to be lower (e.g., 3/12 and 3/16 active=1, both 29)   . Nudging physical activity up one level is therefore the most likely single change to boost your overall TMB test performance."
p025,"(1, 1)","Rationale: For p025, higher self-reported mental engagement tends to coincide with better daily N-back scores (e.g., engaged 3 with scores 28–29 on 3/20–3/22), whereas higher physical activity alone did not consistently help (e.g., active 5 with scores 19 and 3 on 2/25 and 3/17)   . Similar patterns appear in other users’ daily data where more engagement aligns with higher cognitive scores (e.g., p001 score 38 with engaged 4; p043 score 39 with engaged 5)  . Given p025’s TMB profile (processing speed, memory) and already-low anxiety, increasing mental engagement is the most plausible single change to boost TMB outcomes ."
p026,"(1, 1)","Reasoning: p026’s TMB profile is solid but with room to grow (e.g., Matrix Reasoning 28 vs peers reaching 35; Verbal Pairs 23)  , and across our data higher self-reported mental engagement aligns with stronger cognitive task performance; for p026, engagement is often low (1–2) and her better on-the-day scores tend to appear when engagement is at least “somewhat” (e.g., 3/23 engaged=3 score=41; low-engagement days like 3/6–3/7 yielded 23–24)  , while physical activity shows inconsistent links (e.g., active=4 with score=23 on 3/30) and anxiety is already minimal most days  ; similarly, in other users, high on-the-day performance co-occurs with higher engagement (e.g., p001 engaged=4, score=42) supporting a “raise mental engagement” nudge for the biggest payoff on TMB attention/processing and memory tests ."
p027,"(1, 1)","Boosting mental engagement by one level is the most direct lever on the cognitive TMB outcomes: p027 shows room in working memory and speed (Forward Digit Span 5; Choice Reaction Time 6.73), and their lowest daily N-back occurred on a “never engaged” day (score 18 on 2023-04-04) versus higher scores when engagement rose (29 on 2023-04-05), indicating engagement is high‑impact for this user  ."
p028,"(1, 1)","Increase mental engagement by 1 level: p028’s TMB scores leave room for improvement (e.g., Digit Symbol 41; Verbal Paired 12) compared with peers like p026 (72 and 23) , and on this user’s days, higher engagement aligns with better working‑memory N‑back (8 with engagement=1 on 2023‑03‑13 vs 25–26 with engagement=2–3 on 2023‑04‑07/04‑06) ; activity and social levels show mixed links (active=5 yet score=17 on 2023‑03‑17; low social yet score=23 on 2023‑04‑01), and anxiety is already minimal most days ."
p029,"(3, 1)","Increase social engagement by 1 level. p029’s TMB scores leave room to improve (e.g., Digit Symbol Matching 48; Verbal Paired Associates 22) , while their watch data show social contact is almost always “never” (social_num=1) across many days  . In contrast, physical activity is frequently high and mental engagement is moderate-to-high with anxiety already minimal, so boosting social contact is the biggest modifiable lever for added cognitive stimulation   ."
p030,"(0, 1)","Mental engagement is already at (or near) the ceiling for you most days (e.g., engaged_num = 5 on 2023-03-19 and again later in April; anxiety is also minimal at 1)  , while physical activity varies and is often low (active_num = 1–2 on several days, such as 2023-03-26 and 2023-04-03)  . Given your TMB profile shows room to improve in speeded/executive tasks (Choice Reaction Time 8.07; Matrix Reasoning 21)  and that activity is the lever with the most headroom for you, increasing physical activity by one level is the most promising change."
p031,"(1, 1)","Reason: p031’s weakest TMB area is verbal memory (Verbal Paired Associates Memory = 5), far below many peers who commonly score in the teens or 20s, e.g., p026 = 23 and p047 = 24  . On days when p031 reported higher mental engagement (engaged_num = 3), their daily N‑back scores were among their best (34–35 on 2023‑04‑06 and 2023‑04‑07), suggesting cognitive stimulation boosts performance; anxiety is already minimal, making mental engagement the highest‑leverage change  ."
p032,"(1, 1)","Increase mental engagement: across users, higher TMB performers report higher engagement (p026 shows high TMB scores, e.g., Digit Symbol 72 and VPA 23, with frequent engaged=4; p030 has high Digit Symbol 66 with engaged=5 often)   , and p032’s own best daily N‑back scores occurred on higher‑engagement days (e.g., 39 when engaged=4 on 2023‑04‑06 vs. lower when engaged=1–2)   ."
p033,"(0, 1)","Reason: p033 usually reports low physical activity (often 1–2) while mental engagement is already high (often 4–5) in her daily logs, so the biggest “room to grow” is activity; her TMB scores are mid-range, and among higher-scoring users we often see moderate-to-high activity, suggesting nudging activity up is the most promising lever (p033 examples: 2023-04-06 active 1.0, engaged 4.0; 2023-04-12 active 1.0, engaged 5.0; TMB profile: Choice RT 8.48, Digit Symbol 54, Matrix 18, Verbal Pairs 12.

p035,"(1, 1)","Reason: Your TMB profile shows room to grow on speed and memory (e.g., Choice RT 9.02, Digit Symbol 62, Forward Digit Span 7, Matrix Reasoning 32 in the TMB data for p035 ). In your daily data, higher self‑reported mental engagement aligns with better N‑back performance (engaged 3 with scores 35 and 36 on 2023‑03‑30 and 2023‑04‑11  ), while anxiety is already minimal on those days, suggesting that increasing mental engagement by one level is the most promising lever."
p036,"(1, 1)","Reason: p036’s TMB scores are modest , and in the watch data higher daily cognitive scores align most with higher mental engagement—e.g., 30 when engaged=5 on 2023-04-07 and 2023-04-10   versus 16–25 when engagement ≤2 on 2023-04-06, 2023-04-17, and 2023-03-26   ; a similar pattern appears in other users (p100: 30 at engaged=5 vs 28 at engaged=2) , so increasing mental engagement by one level is the most promising lever."
p037,"(1, 1)","Increase mental engagement by 1 level: in this dataset, users with stronger TMB performance tend to report higher mental engagement (e.g., p035’s higher TMB Digit Symbol 62, Matrix 32, Verbal 22 alongside frequent moderate engagement in daily logs), and for you, your better daily N-back scores align with higher self-rated engagement (e.g., 21 when engaged=4 vs. 16–20 when engaged=1–2); your anxiety is already minimal, so lowering it further is unlikely to help, and links from activity/social to TMB are less consistent here     ."
p038,"(1, 1)","Increase mental engagement by 1 level: p038’s TMB scores are comparatively low (e.g., Digit Symbol Matching 20; Forward Digit Span 4; Verbal Paired Associates 11 ) relative to many peers with higher processing-speed/memory scores (e.g., Digit Symbol 64–73 in p065/p073 ). In this user’s daily data, higher mental engagement days align with better N‑back performance (scores 29–30 when engaged=4 on 2023‑03‑22 and 2023‑04‑09 ), whereas anxiety is already minimal and activity/social show mixed links ."
p039,"(1, 1)","Rationale: For p039, higher N-back scores tended to occur on days with higher self-reported mental engagement (e.g., score 28 when engaged=2 on 2023-03-30 vs 32–33 when engaged=3–4 on 2023-03-31 and 2023-04-11), suggesting engagement is the most responsive lever for cognition in her data   . Her TMB profile shows room to boost memory and processing-speed domains (e.g., Verbal Paired Associates 11; Digit Symbol 43), which are likely to benefit from richer daily cognitive engagement . Anxiety is already often minimal, and physical or social levels show mixed within-user links to scores, so increasing mental engagement by one level is the most promising change."
p040,"(1, 1)","Reasoning: p040’s TMB profile shows most room to grow in working memory and reasoning (Forward Digit Span 4; Matrix Reasoning 15), domains tied closely to cognitive engagement .

Anxiety is already minimal most days (anxious_num=1), leaving little to gain from that lever , and peers with stronger TMB results illustrate headroom (e.g., Digit Symbol 61–76; Forward Digit Span 5–9) that engagement-focused changes could help approach ."
p041,"(1, 1)","Rationale: p041’s TMB profile is already strong across the targeted tests (Choice RT 8.54, Digit Symbol 61, Forward Digit Span 5, Matrix Reasoning 27, Verbal Paired Associates 18), and her higher-engagement days frequently involve cognitively demanding teaching/planning tasks (engaged=4) while anxiety is typically minimal, leaving mental engagement as the most promising lever for further gains (examples 2023-04-11 and 2023-04-07 show engaged=4 with low anxiety; TMB scores from tmb.json)   ."

Across users, higher performers on speeded tasks often show frequent mental engagement in their day logs (e.g., p059 has high Digit Symbol 65 and logs frequent engagement with solid N-back scores) . Within p042’s own days, higher N-back scores tend to coincide with more engagement (e.g., score 29 with engaged=always on 2023-04-09 vs score 21 with engaged=never on 2023-03-27), while anxiety is already minimal and social contact is often high, leaving mental engagement as the most actionable lever to nudge up ."
p043,"(1, 1)","Reason: For p043, higher daily N-back scores aligned with higher mental engagement (e.g., engaged=4 with scores 32–34 on 2023-04-20 and 2023-04-25; low engagement day engaged=1 had score 29 on 2023-04-12)   . Her TMB profile leaves room to boost processing speed and memory (Digit Symbol 49; Verbal Paired Associates 17) relative to peers, so nudging mental engagement up is the most targeted lever among the options, while anxiety is already minimal and physical activity/social levels did not consistently coincide with her best scores  ."
p044,"(1, 1)","Reasoning: For p044, higher daily mental engagement aligns with better same-day N‑back scores (e.g., engaged 3–4 with scores 30–33 on 2023-04-04 and 2023-04-11 vs lower scores 17–28 on low-engagement days 2023-03-29 and 2023-04-10)    , a pattern also seen in another user (p043: engaged 4, score 34) . Given p044’s TMB targets (Choice RT, Digit Symbol, Forward Digit Span, Matrix Reasoning, Verbal Pairs) , boosting mental engagement is the most promising lever; physical activity and social contact show mixed associations for p044, and anxiety is already minimal most days, limiting room for benefit  ."
p045,"(1, 1)","Reason: Your TMB profile shows more room to improve on speeded tasks (Choice Reaction Time 6.82; Digit Symbol 43) than on memory/reasoning (Forward Digit Span 7; Matrix 31; Verbal Paired Associates 23), and many peers score higher on the speeded tests (e.g., p047: Digit Symbol 76, Choice RT 12.32)  . In your daily data, higher mental engagement aligns with better N‑back scores (e.g., engaged=3 with scores 27 and 30 on 2023-06-06 and 2023-06-09 vs engaged=1 with 23 on 2023-05-25), whereas your anxiety is usually at the floor, so lowering it further likely adds little   ."

In your daily data, mental engagement is already high (often 4–5) and social contact is maxed (5), while anxiety fluctuates and at times spikes high (e.g., “always anxious” = 5 on 2023-06-08; 4 on 2023-06-07) , and physical activity is consistently low (1–2) even on high-engagement days (e.g., 2023-05-30 to 2023-05-31) . Across this cohort, the most leverage for cognitive performance like processing speed and memory is likely reducing anxiety rather than pushing already-high engagement or social contact further; thus, a one-level decrease in anxiety is the best bet for improving your TMB scores."
p047,"(1, 1)","Reason: Across users, stronger TMB performance clusters with cognitively demanding days; for example, a top scorer (p001) on Digit Symbol Matching (87) regularly reports higher engagement levels, suggesting mental engagement is the most direct lever for improving attention, processing speed, working memory, reasoning, and associative memory targeted by your TMB tests (your own TMB baseline: Choice RT 12.32, Digit Symbol 76, Forward Digit Span 9, Matrix Reasoning 35, Verbal Paired Associates 24)  . You also have room to move up from frequent “never/rarely engaged” days, while anxiety is already minimal (e.g., 2023-06-09 to 2023-06-11 show low engagement and anxiety = 1)  ."
p048,"(1, 1)","Reason: In the TMB results, your strongest domain is processing speed (Digit Symbol Matching 69), while your relative weaknesses are Matrix Reasoning (25) and especially Verbal Paired Associates Memory (14); increasing mental engagement most directly targets reasoning and memory, the areas with the most room to improve for you . Your day-level data also suggest better short-term cognitive scores on more engaged days (e.g., 2023-06-05 engaged_num=3, score=37 vs 2023-05-31 engaged_num=1, score=24; 2023-06-08 engaged_num=2, score=31), supporting a push to raise engagement by one level ."

p050,"(1, 1)","p050 usually reports never/rarely being mentally engaged (engaged_num 1–2) across days, while their TMB scores sit mid-pack (e.g., Choice Reaction Time 9.87; Digit Symbol Matching 48)   . In contrast, users who more often report higher mental engagement (e.g., p001 with frequent/somewhat engagement) tend to show stronger TMB performance, such as a top-end Digit Symbol score of 87 alongside good reaction time, supporting that raising mental engagement is the most promising lever for improving TMB speed, memory, and reasoning for p050   ."
p051,"(1, 1)","Reason: Your weaker TMB areas are memory-heavy (Verbal Paired Associates 13; Backward Digit Span 4) relative to speeded tasks (Digit Symbol 51), so nudging daily mental engagement up is the most direct lever to boost recall and reasoning across tests (). With anxiety already low and social contact often high in your daily logs (e.g., anxious_num 1.0 and social_num 5.0 on 2023-06-03/04/14), targeting engagement offers more upside than further reducing anxiety or increasing already-frequent socializing (; ; )."
p052,"(3, 1)","Reasoning: Your TMB profile shows room to improve processing speed and reasoning (e.g., Digit Symbol Matching 24 and Matrix Reasoning 5) . You already report maximal physical activity and mental engagement and low anxiety on most days, leaving social contact as the main modifiable lever; on some days you report “never had social contact” despite being active/engaged (e.g., 2023-06-14: active 5, engaged 5, social 1), while other days you’re highly social (e.g., 2023-06-21: social 5)  . Across users with stronger TMB performance, regular social contact is common (e.g., p053 with higher Matrix Reasoning and Verbal memory often reports social 4–5; p015 with high Digit Symbol also reports strong social contact)    . Increasing social engagement by one level is therefore the most promising change."
p053,"(1, 1)","Reason: Across users, higher TMB performance tends to coincide with more frequent mental engagement; for example, a top performer (p047) with very strong TMB scores (e.g., Digit Symbol Matching 76; Matrix Reasoning 35) repeatedly reported cognitively demanding, highly engaged days (e.g., “eight hour class,” “paperwork/organizing materials,” engaged 4–5) and showed strong day-level cognitive scores as well   . For p053 specifically, baseline TMB scores are mid-range (e.g., Digit Symbol Matching 38; Forward Digit Span 8; Matrix Reasoning 28; Verbal Paired Associates 23), and many daily logs show “somewhat” engaged (3), leaving room to move to “frequently” (4) to target memory, processing speed, and reasoning without needing to lower already-minimal anxiety or further boost often-adequate activity/social levels   ."

Given your current TMB baseline (Choice Reaction Time 7.52; Digit Symbol Matching 52; Forward Digit Span 8; Matrix Reasoning 29; Verbal Paired Associates 20), raising sustained mental engagement is the most plausible lever for broad gains across these domains using the all-users TMB set as context for which abilities are measured ."
p057,"(0, 1)","Rationale: p057’s processing speed is a key weakness (TMB Digit Symbol Matching = 31), so the biggest upside likely comes from nudging physical activity up one level; across users, higher performers on processing-speed tasks often show more active days (e.g., p059 has Digit Symbol 65 and multiple 3–5 activity-level days), and p057’s own daily N‑back scores were higher on a more active day (28 when active=2 vs 18 when active=1)."

Your logs show engagement is often only “rarely” or “somewhat” (e.g., 2023-09-26 engaged_num=2; 2023-10-06 engaged_num=3), so nudging it up by one level is feasible; anxiety is already low (typically 1–2), leaving less to gain there  ."

p097,"(1, 1)","Across users, higher TMB performance co-occurs most with higher self-reported mental engagement (e.g., high-scoring p001 reports frequent engagement), while p097’s TMB profile is low and their engagement is often only rare/somewhat—so raising mental engagement one level is the strongest bet    ."
p098,"(1, 1)","Reason: p098 has room to improve on several cognitive TMB tests (e.g., Digit Symbol Matching 32 and Verbal Paired Associates 9), and these domains typically benefit most from more consistent mental engagement rather than changes to activity, anxiety, or socializing; for this user, strong daily N‑back scores often occur on “somewhat engaged” days (e.g., 34–35 on 2024‑05‑13 and 2024‑05‑14), while higher physical activity alone did not coincide with better scores (e.g., 28 on 2024‑04‑30)    ."
p099,"(1, 1)","Increase mental engagement by 1 level — across users, higher engagement aligns with better TMB processing speed, reasoning, and memory (e.g., p082 actively taking classes shows higher Digit Symbol 50 and Verbal Pairs 20 ; p094 is often highly engaged and scores Matrix 29 and Verbal Pairs 18 ), and for p099, days with more engagement coincide with better daily N‑back versus low‑engagement days (May 5 vs May 3) ; given p099’s baseline TMB profile has room to grow (e.g., Digit Symbol 35, Forward Span 4) , nudging engagement is the most targeted lever among the options."
p100,"(1, 1)","Reason: p100’s weakest TMB domain is verbal associative memory (score 6) while speed is already solid (Digit Symbol 66; Choice RT 13.01); many peers score in the teens/20s on verbal associates, highlighting this gap, so nudging mental engagement up is the most targeted lever, especially since her daily logs often show low engagement (1–2) and anxiety is already minimal     ."
p101,"(1, 1)","Reasoning: Your highest daily N‑back scores occurred on days you reported higher mental engagement (level 3), such as 2024‑07‑12 (score 40) and 2024‑07‑03 (score 36), while your lowest scores (28) happened on disengaged days like 2024‑06‑19 and 2024‑06‑20; this pattern suggests that boosting engagement is most likely to improve attention/working‑memory–heavy TMB measures (e.g., your Choice RT 12.15, Digit Symbol 60, VPA 15) relative to other levers, which were either already low (anxiety) or less consistently tied to your best scores in your logs    ."
p102,"(1, 1)","Your TMB profile shows room to improve in processing speed and memory (Digit Symbol 36; Forward Digit Span 5), and on your daily N‑back, higher mental engagement days tend to coincide with better scores (e.g., 31 on 6/27 with engaged=3 vs 15 on 6/18 with engaged=2), while anxiety is already minimal and activity/social effects are mixed—so nudging mental engagement up one level is the best bet   ."
p103,"(1, 1)","Increase mental engagement by 1 level: p103’s TMB profile leaves room to improve (Choice RT 5.85; Digit Symbol 33; Forward Span 5; Matrix 14; Verbal Pairs 11) , and on her own days higher engagement tracks with better N‑back performance (e.g., 22 on 2024‑06‑10 with engaged=4 vs 17 on 2024‑06‑17 with engaged=2)  ; across users, strong TMB performers like p047 (Digit Symbol 76; Matrix 35; Verbal Pairs 24) frequently report high mental engagement in daily logs, consistent with higher cognitive scores  ."
p104,"(1, 1)","Rationale: p104’s mental engagement is consistently at the floor (engaged_num=1 on multiple days)  , and their TMB profile has headroom in speed and associative memory (Digit Symbol Matching 49; Verbal Paired Associates 9) ; across users, higher-engagement days coincide with stronger cognitive-task scores (e.g., p094 engaged=5 with N-back 33; p083 engaged=4–5 with N-back 26–27)   , so nudging engagement up is the most targeted lever."
p105,"(1, 1)","Rationale: Your best daily cognitive scores occurred on days you reported higher mental engagement (e.g., 41 with engaged=4 and social=5 on 2024-07-09; 40 with engaged=3 and social=5 on 2024-06-30), whereas a low score day aligned with minimal engagement (29 with engaged=1 and social=1 on 2024-06-18)   . Given your already-strong TMB baseline (e.g., Digit Symbol Matching 69; Matrix Reasoning 36) and typically low anxiety, nudging mental engagement up by one level is the clearest lever to further support speed, working memory, and learning performance  ."
p106,"(1, 1)","Reason: p106’s TMB profile shows room to grow on memory/processing tasks (e.g., Digit Symbol Matching 45; Verbal Paired Associates 11), which trails many peers who are in the high teens to mid‑20s on verbal memory (e.g., p001=24, p026=23, p053=23), so nudging mental engagement up is the most direct lever to improve TMB outcomes; meanwhile anxiety is already at the floor most days and can’t be lowered further, a higher‑social day coincided with elevated irritability and heart rate for p106, and spikes in physical activity haven’t aligned with better same‑day N‑back scores for her (p106 TMB: ; peer TMB examples:   ; p106 daily engagement/anxiety/activity/social patterns and N‑back examples: 2024‑08‑03/04/09/12/13/10/18 logs in     ; social spike with irritability/HR: 2024‑08‑18 in )."
